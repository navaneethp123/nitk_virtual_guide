# NITK_Virtual_Guide

Task by Dev Sudents Club (Web Club NITK).

Task: Build a mobile app that will act as a guide for students or any guest visiting NITK.
Some eg: News, events, Mess Menu, Maps.

I'm trying to implement the app in Flutter. If possible, I'm hoping to use
Firebase sdk to fetch data from Firebase.
